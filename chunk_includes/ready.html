<p>So, to wrap up. Your task is to decide whether the letter string on the screen is a word.
<br>- If you think the letter string is a word, press 'j'.
<br>- If you think the letter string is NOT a word, press 'f'.
<br>You need to do this as fast as possible.
</p>

<p>In this experiment you will go through 320 items. 
<br>It may sound a lot, but it won't take more than 10-12 minutes.
<br>You will have the chance to get some rest every 40 items.
</p>

<p>The experiment starts now. When you are ready to begin, press 'j'.</p>
