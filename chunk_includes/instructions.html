<p>In this experiment you will see strings of letters at the center of the screen. 
<br> Your task is to decide whether that string of letters is a word or not in the fastest time possible.
</p>

<p>
<br>- If you think the string is a word, press 'j' on your keyboard. 
<br>- If you think the string is NOT a word, press 'f' on your keyboard.
</p>

<p>Before beginning the actual experiment, let's do some practice.
